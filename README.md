# Blockchain Data Structures and Algorithms

Attached are some basic blockchain data structures and algorithms.

* Ethereum uses trie's to store account balances, so if you understand this data structure you understand a part of their protocol
* Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism and I have managed to implement it in a few lines
* Merkle trees are used for verifying data integrity across almost all cryptocurrencies
* k-array tree is the data structure you can use to make a trie
